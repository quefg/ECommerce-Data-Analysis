## Problem Definition
Our problem definition revolves around patterns within e-commerce operations to address key challenges: how to predict the price of a good.

## Models Used
Multiple regression models, including linear regression and decision tree regressors, were evaluated. 
Models were trained on the training dataset and evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared. 

## Results and Insights
The project successfully developed a model capable of predicting product prices with significant accuracy. Key insights include:
- Category Influence: Product category significantly affects pricing predictions, more so than brand or individual sales data.
- Model Performance: While some models showed a tendency to overfit, careful feature selection and regularization may mitigate this issue.
- Predictive Power: The final model demonstrated strong predictive capabilities, with an R-squared value indicating a good fit to the unseen data.

## Conclusion
This machine learning project provides a robust framework for predicting e-commerce product prices, aiding businesses in making informed decisions about pricing strategies and inventory management. Future work will focus on integrating more dynamic data sources and exploring more complex model architectures.

## What did we learn from this project?
- Enhance Data Collection: To improve model robustness and address overfitting, more diverse and comprehensive data should be collected. This includes finer details on customer demographics, buying behavior, and perhaps more granular cost details.
- Utilize Advanced Modeling Techniques: Employing more sophisticated machine learning techniques such as ensemble methods or neural networks might help in handling complexities better and improving prediction accuracy while avoiding overfitting.
